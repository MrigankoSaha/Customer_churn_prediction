# Customer_churn_prediction

#With customer churn remaining a crucial issue for most businesses today, this study
 predicts the factors resulting in customer churn using the Telco Customer Churn
 dataset. The models, logistic regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and random forest
 are employed for prediction. The random forest model, which has the highest accuracy,
 highlights that tenure, contract type, payment method and monthly charges have the
 most influence on customer churn. Based on the results, this project aims to provide
 insights for Telco to reduce churn rates and improve customer retention strategies.

 # Key Insights-->
 
 #This study reveals that tenure, contract type, payment method, and monthly
 charges are the key factors leading to churn.
 
 ❖ Shorter tenures are associated with higher churn risk.
 
 ❖ Longer-term contracts likely reduce churn compared to month-to-month plans.
 
 ❖ Customers with auto-payment methods are less likely to churn compared to
 those using electronic checks
 
 ❖ Monthly charges underscore the importance of pricing, as higher costs may
 increase dissatisfaction and lead to churn.
